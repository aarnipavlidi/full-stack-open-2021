## 9.25: patientor, step10

Following code works for "9.26: patientor, step11" and "9.26: patientor, step12" as well!

Made sure that on every entry, fields are required (so user is not able to send empty data to database!)
and also every entry gets saved into database as well and shows back for the user on current patient page!

Have commented some of the files, which gives basic understanding of this app and how it works.
